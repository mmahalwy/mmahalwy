As I have started to build my startup, I ran into a few problems that I _really wish_ were solved or there are solutions for these. By no means have I went to turn every rock to see if there is a solution for my problems (although I do extensive research). This is an ongoing list I will update regularly. Feel free to reach out if you want to learn more.

### Email rendering, testing

- Rails ActionMailer and HTML is great to start, and [letter_opener gem](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) makes it easy to test on dev
- VERY hard to test on dev once you don't render HTML in source code (Sengrid)
- VERY hard to create beautiful emails and render to HTML string via API (makes it easier to generate, then send off to provider of choice)

### Managing files

- [Flatfile.io](https://flatfile.io) is very cool for uploading CSVs. [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com/), [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/) and many are great for uploading files, images, videos, etc. [Docspring](https://docspring.com/) is very neat for filling out PDFs via API
- But it's still hard to generate files for a user output. For example, we have to generate a PDF for our end user. My hack is to build it in React on Nextjs, then server-side render for my Rails app which then will upload to cloud, save cdn url to DB, etc.
- Another is I now have to zip a few files together (call them from CDN, then zip them) and it's been painful to learn about [`Tempfile`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/tempfile/rdoc/Tempfile.html), and more in Ruby land

### Travel insurance

- Travel insurance really sucks. The buying experience is unpleasant and antiquated, especially for someone who frequently travels across countries (nomads)
- The experience also stops at the certificate – a huge loss of opportunity for partnership with travel companies (use our travel insurance, get a discount at Hilton as an example)
- Insurance, since for the most part is a 'need' not a 'want', is a huge channel for partnership. I love what [Walnut](https://gowalnut) is doign with Life Insurance

### TurboTax for LLCs, Trusts and others

- It's really hard to navigate the investment world from a governance and logsitcal perspective. Should I invest in a property and put it behind an LLC? Should I sign up for a self-directed IRA? When should I create a Trust and how much will it cost me?
- These questions are usually solved with 'it depends' – but this was brilliantly solved in the accounting world with TurboTax
- Potential to manage the entity and have recurring revenue

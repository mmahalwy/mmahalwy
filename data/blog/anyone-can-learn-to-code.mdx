**Jan 25, 2013**. That was the day I got my first 'Newbie' award from [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mohamedelmahallawy) after finishing my first few coding classes.
While it looks like a while ago (7+ years!), it still feels like it wasn't that long ago [Tristan](https://twitter.com/tristantoye) and I were sitting in [Bilal's](https://twitter.com/sBilalHusain)
living room and picking up Ruby on Rails for the first time.

Over the past 7 years, many have asked me about how I went from a Psychology and Economics graduate from McMaster University to a Software Engineer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) and living in San Francisco.
Well, this is the story to have it happened and how you can learn to code as well.

### Do something daring

During my 3rd year of university, I noticed that SMS marketing and communication was going to become more common than it was before. Long were the days of expensive cell phone plans with limits on minutes and SMS count.
It's 2012, and mobile was exploding. I figured, after noticing SMS so commonly used in other countries, that SMS marketing was going to be a thing. Little did I know now that we were right, just too early for our
time and under-equipped to become successful entrepreneurs.

We started a company called Nervu. Nervu promised to notify you about deals at local businesses through SMS. Simply, sign up, select who you want to hear from and you'll get notified. It was simple, but daring for 4
university students to think about. Especially a school that was very heavy on the sciences, entrepreneurship was not a common theme people spoke about. But, it helped us get publicity and attention to our large dreams.
After all, we were starving students who wanted to walk in the footsteps of giants like Zuckerberg. So we set out to build this company without having technical expertise or help.

We were lucky to win [multiple awards and cash prizes](https://www.thespec.com/business/2012/10/04/tidy-feeder-cleans-up-at-lion-s-lair.html) throughout the city of Hamilton and across university. It put us at the table with
the city's smartest and most successful. For that, we are so fortunate and thankful.

**Key learnings**

- Dream big, dream large. It will push you as a person and force you to learn
- Being right is one thing. Being on time is another. 2015 and 2016 saw entrants into the SMS marketing space that are doing very well today
- Being a student is not an excuse for not having enough time or money. On the contrary, being a student and ambitious makes you that much bigger and draws more attention to you. Use it wisely

### Step outside your comfort zone

Although the prizes and tailwind behind us, we ultimately failed as a startup and as founders. We didn't execute and reach market fit. We had a number of customers and a few hundred signups, but did not make any money.
After shutting down the company, we were left thinking what to do next. I loved the rush of entrepreneurship and knew this is the future for me. But I was too lazy and too comfortable to do anything about it.
The late Jim Rudnick once asked me "why aren't you learning to code?", and I replied "I have no time". He then looked at me and said "well then, sleep less. How many hours of sleep do you get?". "8 hours on average. I really value my sleep". After thinking about it some more. He was right.

And that was the turning point in my life. I decided to learn to code after realizing I was too comfortable with where I was and the only way to cross that bridge, is to work harder and invest in myself.

In parallel with learning to code, I decided to double down on diversifying my future and completed my real estate license in Ontario.

**Key learnings**

- You only grow when you push yourself out of your comfort zone
- Laziness is the enemy and the barrier to most learnings and growth

### Learning to code

You're probably bored so far and waiting to get to this section. So how _did_ I learn to code? Well, there is unfortunately no magic to it and no shortcuts. I will outline how I did in more details in another post but to answer
the question, it was a number of ways. Here is a short guide:

**Start small, then build up.**
Coding is like going to the gym. Don't expect to lift the same amount as professional body builders can on the first day. It takes time, patience and persistence. I found starting with [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to be really effective to
give you an overview of _what_ coding is and dappling with some languages. I **strongly** recommend starting with HTML and CSS to begin.

**Why HTML and CSS to begin?**
It's technically coding and pretty basic. It will give you an understanding of how hard it is to learn to code (syntax, debugging, etc) and give you the instant gratification of results. It's not what I do on a daily basis (I hardly do HTML and CSS now).
If you're not enjoying it, then, maybe, coding might be difficult to pick up. Do something you enjoy, not something you drag.

Lastly, HTML and CSS has a large amount of documentation and help. You'll almost find everything you're looking for on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

**Up next**
Great, you flew threw the HTML and CSS course on Codecademy. Well done! Now, do it again. And once you're done that, I'd recommend taking a course on Team Treehouse for HTML and CSS.

**Ok, now what?**
Well, now that you're a master in HTML and CSS, here is your next project. What I realized is coding is best learnt through doing, not watching and following. You often times learn about new things through trying to create something.
In the process, you also start to build muscle memory and general memory for the syntax and rules of the language you're writing in. I always recommend for folks to create their resume through HTML and CSS.
It will give you exposure into creating something you already have (hopefully on a doc somewhere) and turn it into code.

**Moving up**
Next, let's now move into more complex problems. You need to learn a language that can help you store data, manipulate it, etc. I'd recommend learning Javascript. Javascript has become a very popular language in recent years
with the explosion of better user interfaces and experiences

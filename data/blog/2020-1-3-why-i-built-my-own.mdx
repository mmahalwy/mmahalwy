For some time now, I been longing to start writing and blogging again.
I previously wrote on Medium quite a bit and was an avid consumer of content on
Medium in the early days. But things changed when click-bait became a common
curse amongst many Medium posts. Slowly and slowly I found myself consuming
less on Medium and more on Twitter. Adding the recent uprise of paywalls, I decided to look for
an alternative solution.

### Can I use Notion?

I love [Notion](https://notion.so). With more and more of my life moving onto Notion, I figured
Notion would be a nature fit. The challenge there is while I can create multiple pages to be public,
it lacked features that were important to me if I wanted to take this seriously. It lacked Google Analytics
tracking and other social features such as a signup form.

**What about using their API?**

They don't currently have a public API but I figured I can reverse engineer their existing on to use. Well...
it's not that easy after all ðŸ™ƒ

As you can see, the API is pretty cryptic and hard to understand. So, I decided to give up on that. Maybe
at a later date when they release their offial API, I will move my blog to be powered by them.

**What about a headless CMS?**

These are becoming popular these days. Some include:

- [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/)
- [Contentful](https://contentful.com)
- [Contentstack](https://contentstack.com)
  and many more.

I decided against them because:

1. They were expensive
2. They didn't have very good support for code snippets
3. Limited customization

**Let's just build our own, right?**
Lately, I been looking into using Nextjs. I picked it up over a year ago but didn't do much with it.
The promise of writing React with all the benefits of server side rendering, SEO friendliness, speed,
and 1 command deploy is very appealing.

The challenge is getting my .MD files to a page, then getting a way to get a list of all my posts in
an organized way.

This was a challenge.

I was inspired by Dan Abramov's [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) that is built
using Gatsbyjs. After many hours and digging and hacking, I stumbled upon this [github repo](https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit).
I forked it to make some changes of my own to make this work for me. This post is written in MDX (MD + JSX).

It allows me to write in MD with the added benefit of having JSX/TSX when needed. In addition, I can create
very specific customizations that are unique to me and my site. More on that later.

You can find the code for this blog [here](https://github.com/mmahalwy/mmahalwy). Feel free to copy it, fork it
or do whatever you like with it.

Hi there!
The last few weeks have been a very stressful time for everyone as we go through these world events together.
Some friends and family members have reached out asking for help on their resumes in fear of losing their job or recently lost one.

After speaking with my wife, we want to offer our time and help to anyone seeking a review on of resume.

Below is my calendar page for anyone to schedule some time, whether to speak about your resume, job search or general advice. Layan's calendar will be coming soon.

[Link to calendar](https://x.ai/calendar/mmahalwy/resume)

We are here for you and look forward to speaking!

-- Mo & Layan

#### FAQ

**What's the catch?**
This is completely free; no hugs, cookies or high fives needed. This is us wanting to help out where we can.

**I'd like to offer my time, how do I reach out?**
If you'd like to open up your calendar and offer help too, please reach out to me at [mmahalwy@gmail.com](mailto:mmahalwy@gmail.com).

**Is there format?**
Nope! The time is yours. Use it however you want. We can dig deep into your resume, we can chat about career, or how you're feeling.
If you wish to speak about your resume, we'd recommend putting it on Google Docs and sharing it. That way, we can collaborate with
edits and comments.

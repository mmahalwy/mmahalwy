Hi there!
The last few weeks have been a very stressful time for everyone as we go through these world events
together. Some friends and family members have reached out to ask for extra help looking at their resumes in fear of losing their job or have already lost one.

After speaking with my wife about this, we want to get involved and help by offering an extra set of eyes. Sometimes it's the difference between
a good resume and a great one.

Below is a calendar page for anyone to schedule time to chat, whether you want to speak about your resume, job search or general advice. If you'd like to open up
your calendar and offer help too, please reach out to me at [mmahalwy@gmail.com](mailto:mmahalwy@gmail.com).

We are here for you and look forward to speaking!

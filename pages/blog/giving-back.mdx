Hi there! Thanks for dropping by. I know it's a very stressful time for everyone as we all go through these world events
together. Some friends, and my own mother, have reached out to ask for extra help looking at their resume. Many people are resurfacing
their resumes as they have recently lost their job or fear losing one.

After speaking with my wife about this, we want to get involed and we want to help. Sometimes having an extra pair of eyes is the difference between
a good resume and a great one, and we'd love to offer our time to help out.

Below is a calendar page for anyone to schedule time to chat, whether you want to speak about your resume, job search or general advice.

We are here for you and look forward to speaking!

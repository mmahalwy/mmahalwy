[Mo's Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/mmahalwy) | [Connect](https://x.ai/calendar/mmahalwy/resume)

We are _VERY_ lucky to have all these incredible people offer their time. On a personal note, and as someone who works at Airbnb and had witness 25% of our team say goodbye, I can't imagine how difficult it is to worry about work,
career, visa and family during these tough times. If you are affected, I am sorry. Just know, there are very kind people out there who want to help and who are willing to offer their time to see others succeed. This is only a small subset
of the people out there looking to help but know that you are cared for and things will get much better.

### FAQ

**What's the catch?**<br />
This is completely free; no hugs, cookies or high fives needed. This is us wanting to help out where we can.

**I'd like to offer my time, how do I reach out?**<br />
If you'd like to open up your calendar and offer help too, please reach out to me at [mmahalwy@gmail.com](mailto:mmahalwy@gmail.com).

**Is there format?**<br />
Nope! The time is yours. Use it however you want. We can dig deep into your resume, we can chat about career, or how you're feeling.
If you wish to speak about your resume, we'd recommend putting it on Google Docs and sharing it. That way, we can collaborate with
edits and comments.
